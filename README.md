Aliasing for updateBranch and makeTransaction is partial. 
The alias would sign in as root from where we can 'exit' and then type in the password (pass12345) to get into the BranchManager1's/UserAcc1's account. Then, we can run the ./updateBranch / ./makeTransaction script. Alternatively, one can directly sudo into the Branch Manager's / User's account and then run the script from there.
